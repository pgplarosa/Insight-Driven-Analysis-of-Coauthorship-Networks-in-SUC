## Executive Summary

<p align="justify">Presenting insights into the existing collaboration dynamics of state universities and colleges (SUC) in the Philippines with the objective of contributing to the optimization of the R&D productivity. This is a critical component in the generation of new knowledge, fostering innovation, and the long-term economic development of a developing country.</p>

<p align="justify">We identified three progressive profiles of SUC co-authorship networks that can be useful in crafting strategies to further collaborations. Profile-1 networks were found to be highly disconnected with no prominent components; instead, they consist of dyads, and small isolated cliques. We also differentiated between co-authorship networks comparable to small-world networks (Profile-2) and Profile-3, which implicates the emergence of large components from the eventual linkage of smaller components found in previous profiles. From here, university-level policies are suggested to develop research collaboration systems.</p>

<p align="justify">We also performed exploratory network analysis to identify critical entities in the networks, exploring various centrality measures focused on insights-extraction. As part of the descriptive analysis, we also extracted network communities that may be significant in helping funding agencies identify relevant R&D programs for various SUCs.</p>

<p align="justify">A projected inter-university author network was also formed using topics as connections. We extracted notable authors and identified communities that can serve as working groups for identified topics.</p>
